## Bounty Scope

### What is Monero Bounties ?
Monero Bounties is a website designed to foster community feedback from users, developers and community stakeholders. It is supplemental / complementary to the existing Monero CCS (Community Crowdfunding System). Users can post bounties for suggested improvements in the monero community. Example bounties could be (but not limited) to the following:

  * Feature requests to existing software
  * New software creation 
  * Research funding into new crypographic requirements 
  * Art projects that promote Monero
  * Translations of documentation or explainer videos 
  * Website or service that should exist (FOSS)

Every posted bounty will have an associated Monero subaddress generated which is used to both incentivize and prioratize community needs. The bounties can be worked on by anybody including the original poster or anonymous individuals. Funds are held in escrow and released once a submitted bounty is complete. There are no associated platform fees and the website is administrered by volunteers (volunteers may accept donations).

### Bounties Payout 

The open nature of accepted bounties can often make defining a specific deliverable difficult. Submissions require a tightly defined deliverable which helps dictate when a submission can be considered ["completed"](https://bounties.monero.social/?view=completed) and a bounty can be paid out. Submissions lacking a properly defined deliverable will be tagged as ["Needs Definition"](https://bounties.monero.social/?tags=needs-definition) by reviewers* and will involve any site visitor to help define the payout criteria more clearly. 

Once the bounty is complete a comment should be left by the bounty hunter including a link to the deliverable and a statement on how each payout criteria was met. Any site visitor can leave a comment to either reaffirm or raise any concerns involving whether the bounty should be considered complete or not. Discussion will be considered on outside platforms, including Reddit and the Monero Matrix Channels.
The reviewers* will contact the escrow holder to release funds, once consensus is reached.


## Bounty scope 

If a bounty has the attributes of a [Monero CCS](https://ccs.getmonero.org/how-to-ccs/), including milestones, targeted to specific person or persons who will work the bounty, or specify a particular required funding threshold; the bounty will be rejected and the user who created the bounty will be referred to the CCS.

### In-Scope
  * Github Issues in Monero related repositories
  * Funding for an advertisement directed to a specific website, individual, or company
  * Cryptographic Research that could assist Monero in the future
  * Funding for written material related to Monero
  * Funding of new projects that are built on-top of or integrate with Monero transactions
  * Maintenance activities related to Monero related projects


### Out-of-Scope 
  * Funding for personal endeavors
  * Funding for proprietary software
  * Funding for work that has already been completed
  * Requesting additional funding for an existing CCS that has not been completed
  * Funding for anything malicious or activities that could be construed as malintent towards any individuals, groups of people, or oneself
  * Funding for artistic endeavors not related to Monero



## Funding policy 

Bounties which have been reviewed and accepted by *reviewers and the site visitors will remain open for a year. After one year of no shown progress the funds raised for *expired bounties will be transfered to the top 5 bounties on the site that have the most funding at that time. A comment will be added to the expired bounties that states funds were transferred to specific bounties. Lastly, the expired bounty will be tagged as ["expired"](https://bounties.monero.social/?tags=expired).

If a bounty hunter would like to work on an expired bounty, they would leave a comment and then a reviewer would remove the "expired" tag. If any funds were previously transferred out of the expired bounty to another bounty, those funds will not be relocated back to the original bounty.

Some bounties will be submitted that may be found to be technically infeasible. Once a subject matter expert comments that the bounty is infeasible the bounty will be tagged as ["Not Feasible"](https://bounties.monero.social/?tags=not-feasible)


## Definitions
Reviewers = Granted the collaborator role within Fider

Expired bounties = bounties that have not been worked on for one year (if work is being done in stealth, progress has to be shown before a year passes)
